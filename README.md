# sudoku-solver

A simple program that can solve any Sudoku!

You can paste a Sudoku puzzle into `sudoku.txt` in this format:

```
8********
**36*****
*7**9*2**
*5***7***
****457**
***1***3*
**1****68
**85***1*
*9****4**
```

*(This is considered one of the hardest Sudokus in the world.)*

After that, run `sudoku.exe`.

Then, open `result.txt` to see the solution!

This program uses the annealing method to find the solution.
